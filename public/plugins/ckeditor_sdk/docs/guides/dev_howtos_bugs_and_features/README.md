# Bugs and New Features

The following article contains tips about reporting CKEditor issues and proposing new features.

## How Do I Report CKEditor Bugs?

The [Reporting Issues](#!/guide/dev_issues_readme) article contains all the information about reporting CKEditor issues.

## How Do I Request New CKEditor Features?

If you feel there is an interesting feature missing in CKEditor, go to the [Development site](http://dev.ckeditor.com/) and file a ticket.

Please make sure you read the [Issues Tracker Site](#!/guide/dev_issues_tracker) article beforehand in order to make it easier for the developers to examine the issue. It is also recommended to start from a search at the [CKEditor Add-ons Repository](http://ckeditor.com/addons/plugins/all) to see whether the proposed functionality has not been implemented yet and offered as a plugin, either an official one or a community-provided add-on.

When submitting a new ticket, feel free to attach your code suggestions or patches that can serve as a prototype for the requested feature.

You are also most welcome to propose code changes with pull requests submitted to the official [ckeditor-dev](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/pulls) repository. Do note that your code should meet some minimum requirements for code style or included tests, so please refer to the [Contributing Code](#!/guide/dev_contributing_code) article for more information.
