# Removing Text Formatting

<p class="requirements">
	This feature is provided through a plugin that is included in the Standard and Full presets available from the official CKEditor <a href="http://ckeditor.com/download">Download</a> site.
</p>

The [Remove Format](http://ckeditor.com/addon/removeformat) plugin provides the ability to quickly remove any text formatting that is applied through inline HTML elements and CSS styles, like [basic text styles](#!/guide/dev_basicstyles) (bold, italic, etc.), font family and size, [text and background colors](#!/guide/dev_colorbutton) or styles applied through the [Styles drop-down](#!/guide/dev_styles). Note that it does not change [text formats](#!/guide/dev_format) applied at block level.

When enabled, the plugin adds the **Remove Format** toolbar button. Since this feature applies to inline styles, you need to select the text fragment whose formatting is to be removed before pressing the button.

The image below shows a sample text with some styling &mdash; different typefaces, font sizes, italics, inline styles and colors &mdash; applied.

The second image presents the same text after the formatting cleanup done through the **Remove Format** feature. Note that block-level text formats (headings, paragraphs, blockquotes etc.) remain unchanged.
