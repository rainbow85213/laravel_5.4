We are not able to fix an issue if we cannot see it with our own eyes. A numbered list of actions to reproduce the issue is invaluable.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser name and OS</strong> &ndash; Your computer configuration, OS, browser name and version.</li>\n<li><strong>Editor configuration</strong> &ndash; Your editor version, integration method, editor build (you can attach your <code>build-config.js</code> file).</li>\n<li><strong>Screenshot</strong> &ndash; For interface-related issues an image speaks more than thousands of words.</li>\n<li><strong>Sample data</strong> &ndash; For content-related issues please attach a sample file from which we can get the text for testing.</li>\n<li><strong>Test case file</strong> &ndash; If possible, attach a test case file showing the issue.
