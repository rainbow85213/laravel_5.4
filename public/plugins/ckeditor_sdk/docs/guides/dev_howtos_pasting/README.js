If however, you want to use Word font styles, including font size, font family, and font foreground/background color, set the <a href=\"#!/api/CKEDITOR.config-cfg-pasteFromWordRemoveFontStyles\" rel=\"CKEDITOR.config-cfg-pasteFromWordRemoveFontStyles\" class=\"docClass\">CKEDITOR.config.pasteFromWordRemoveFontStyles</a> configuration value to <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>config.pasteFromWordRemoveFontStyles = false;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please note that since CKEditor 4.1 you need to add <a href=\"#!/guide/dev_acf\">Advanced Content Filter</a> into the equation, too. The content filtering mechanism makes sure that the data that enters the editor is supported by editor features that are enabled in your configuration (to simplify it: if there is no font or text/background color button in your toolbar, this formatting will be stripped from your Word-formatted text). ACF is a highly flexible tool, though, so you can <a href=\"../samples/acf.html\">easily adjust it to your needs</a>.</p>\n","title":"Pasting","meta_description":"Most frequently asked question and answers about pasting in CKEditor.","meta_keywords":"ckeditor, editor, wysiwyg, howto, howtos, faq, questions, answers, paste, pasting, word, plain, text"});
